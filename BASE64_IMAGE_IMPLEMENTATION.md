# Base64 Image Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of storing images as base64 encoded data directly in Firestore instead of using Firebase Storage. This approach was chosen to avoid the costs associated with Firebase Storage.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Image Upload Process (Admin Dashboard)
- Images are selected via file input in the admin panel
- Each selected image is converted to base64 format using the FileReader API
- The base64 data is stored directly in the Firestore document as part of the product data
- Each image object contains:
  - `name`: Original filename
  - `type`: MIME type of the image
  - `data`: Base64 encoded image data
  - `timestamp`: Upload timestamp

### 2. Image Storage Format
Instead of storing image URLs as strings, we now store image objects:
```javascript
{
  name: "example.jpg",
  type: "image/jpeg",
  data: "data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQEASABIAAD/...",
  timestamp: 1234567890
}
```

### 3. Image Display
- When displaying images in the shop or product detail pages, the base64 data is used directly as the image source
- The browser automatically renders base64 data URLs as images
- Fallback images are provided in case of errors

### 4. Size Limitations
- Images are limited to 1MB each to avoid exceeding Firestore document size limits
- A maximum of 4 images per product is enforced
- File size validation is performed before processing

## Stock Management
- Added stock field to products in the admin panel
- Stock information is displayed in product listings, detail pages, and cart
- Cart functionality respects stock limits to prevent overselling
- Visual indicators show stock status (in stock, low stock, out of stock)

## Star Rating System
- Added rating field (0-5 stars) to products in the admin panel
- Created reusable StarRating component for consistent display
- Star ratings are displayed in product listings and detail pages
- Ratings are shown with visual star icons and numerical values
- Supports decimal ratings (e.g., 4.5, 3.6) with accurate half-star display

## Currency Conversion
- Changed currency display from USD to Colombian Pesos (COP) throughout the application
- Updated price labels in admin panel, shop, product detail, and cart pages
- All price values are now displayed with "COP" prefix instead of "$" symbol

## Input Field Improvements
- Changed number inputs to text inputs in the admin panel for price, stock, and rating fields
- This allows for decimal values in price and rating fields (e.g., 25990, 4.5)
- Values are properly parsed back to numbers when saving to Firestore

## Benefits
1. **Cost-Effective**: No Firebase Storage costs
2. **Simplicity**: No need to manage separate storage buckets
3. **Performance**: Images are loaded directly with the document data
4. **Reliability**: No separate storage service to maintain
5. **Inventory Control**: Stock management prevents overselling
6. **Customer Experience**: Star ratings help customers make informed decisions
7. **Localization**: Currency displayed in Colombian Pesos (COP)
8. **Flexibility**: Text inputs allow for decimal values in key fields

## Limitations
1. **Document Size**: Firestore documents have a 1MB size limit
2. **Bandwidth**: Larger documents may increase bandwidth usage
3. **Querying**: Cannot easily query based on image content

## Files Modified
1. `src/assets/pages/AdminDashboard.jsx` - Implemented base64 conversion and storage, fixed image preview and saving issues, added stock and rating management, changed input types to text, updated currency labels
2. `src/assets/pages/Shop.jsx` - Updated to display base64 images, stock information, star ratings, and COP currency
3. `src/assets/pages/ProductDetail.jsx` - Updated to display base64 images, stock information, star ratings, and COP currency
4. `src/context/CartContext.jsx` - Updated to respect stock limits
5. `src/assets/pages/Cart.jsx` - Updated to display stock information, COP currency, and prevent exceeding stock limits
6. `src/components/StarRating.jsx` - Created new reusable star rating component with improved decimal handling
7. `src/assets/pages/StarRatingTest.jsx` - Created test page for verifying star rating display
8. `src/assets/routes/appRoutes.jsx` - Added route for star rating test page

## Recent Fixes
1. Fixed image preview issues in the admin dashboard modal
2. Fixed saving functionality to properly handle base64 image data
3. Improved error handling for image display across all components
4. Added comprehensive stock management throughout the application
5. Implemented star rating system with visual indicators
6. Improved star rating component to accurately display decimal ratings with proper half-star visualization
7. Changed input fields to text type to allow decimal values for price, stock, and rating
8. Updated currency display from USD to COP throughout the application

## Testing
To test the implementation:
1. Log in as an admin user
2. Navigate to the admin dashboard
3. Create a new product with images, set stock quantity (e.g., 10), price in COP (e.g., 25990), and add a rating (e.g., 4.5)
4. Verify images are displayed correctly in the shop
5. Verify images are displayed correctly in the product detail page
6. Verify stock information is displayed correctly
7. Verify star ratings are displayed correctly with accurate half-star visualization
8. Verify all prices are displayed with COP prefix
9. Visit `/star-rating-test` to see various rating values displayed
10. Test adding products to cart respecting stock limits
11. Test editing existing products and verifying changes are saved correctly
